Project Title: MOViE DATABASE
Description:
The movie Platform Database is a relational database designed to store and manage data for movie lovers. It captures key information about movie title, actors, rating, directors, providing a solid foundation for building a movie application.

How to Run/Setup the Project:
1. Create a new MySQL database: Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin) and create a new database named movie.
2. Import the SQL file: Import the provided SQL file (moviedb.sql) into the movie database. This will create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data.
3. Verify the database: After importing the SQL file, verify that the tables have been created correctly and the sample data has been populated.
